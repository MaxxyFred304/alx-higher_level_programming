10. The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.



Usage: nqueens N

If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4

If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1

The program should print every possible solution to the problem

One solution per line

Format: see example

You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order

You are only allowed to import the sys module
